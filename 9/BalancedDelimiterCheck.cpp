 In order to check for (), {} and [], the following algorithm will be applied:
 - traverse the input string
 - pop every open paranthesis on the stack
 - if any closing paranthesis is found, compare it to the last open one
 - if they match, remove the open one from the stack
 - if they don't match, the string isn't balanced.
 In order to incorporate the checks for "" the logic has been divided in two section, for when the stack is empty and not empty, respectively, as ignoring characters after " presupposes an exisiting top of the stack. Similar logic as for the parantheses applies.
